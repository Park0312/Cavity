# Cavity
This is for Lid-Driven exercise in 2D &amp; 3D condition

C files are for simulating Lid-Driven Cavity exercise and MATLAB files are for analyzing results from simulation.

Large volume of animations are attached by mp4 file.

*Four experiments* are conducted under this C code by adjusting boundary conditions.
1. Lid-Driven Cavity flow at *U_lid=1 & Re=1000*
2. Lid-Driven Cavity flow at *U_lid=1 & Re=100*
3. Lid-Driven Cavity flow at *U_lid=sin(t) & Re=100*
4. Four-Direction Lid-Driven Cavity flow at *U_lid=1 & Re=100*

# 2D Result at Re=1000 (U_lid = 1)
